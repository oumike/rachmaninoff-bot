# Rachmaninoff's Bot
A generic discord bot I'm writing to learn some new stuff and keep status on my local systems.  Feel free to hack/contribute.

## Before running (or developing)
Make sure you have a pip environment setup and install everything in requirements.txt

## To run

Copy settings and environment file examples
```
cp .env.example .env
cp rachmaninoff_bot_example.yml rachmaninoff_bot.yml
```

In each file fill out the required info (tokens for weather, discord, mongodb credentials)

Run bot
```
python bot.py
```
